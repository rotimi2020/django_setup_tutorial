# Django Setup Tutorial (Silent Python Lab)

Welcome to the **Silent Python Lab** Django tutorial series!  

This repository will contain all the tutorials in the series. Each tutorial is organized in its own folder, so you can follow step by step.

## Project Structure

django_setup_tutorial/
- `Part_1_Django_Setup/` — Tutorial folder for Part 1  
- `.gitignore` — Files to ignore (like virtual environments)  
- `README.md` — This main file

## Notes

- Each tutorial part has its own instructions and code inside its folder.
- **Virtual environments (`venv/`) are NOT included** — they are ignored via `.gitignore`.
- As the series grows, new folders like `Part_2`, `Part_3`, etc., will be added for future tutorials.
